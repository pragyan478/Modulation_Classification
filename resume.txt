%     \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
%     \item Prepared a literature survey on the forward and the inverse kinematics for seven degree of freedom (DOF) redundant robot manipulator with emphasis on exploiting the solutions of the forward kinematics.
%     \item Obtained the best configurations having high mobility and vast working space out of all possible ones for three and four DOF manipulators by solving the forward kinematics problems and comparing the functional workspaces.  
%     \item Determined a seven DOF manipulator configuration having maximum workspace when the arm is fully extended and minimum workspace when it is folded.
%     \item Understood the variable buoyancy (VB) technology and proposed a suitable VB system for h-AUV after comparing the various systems qualitatively.

{\large \bf PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN} \vspace{.75ex} \hline \vspace{1ex}
   

{ \bf Video Surveillance for Human States Detection | Undergraduate Project}\\
   \textit{Mentor: Dr. K.S. Venkatesh, Professor, IIT Kanpur}
    \hfill
    \textit{Aug'20-Present}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item  Developed a part of \textbf{human surveillance and logging system} which detects and measures the different aspects of human states logged for each individual against timestamp.
        
        \item The system utilized \textbf{Machine Learning} approaches(\textbf{YOLO, attention blocks, etc}) as well as traditional \textbf{Image Processing techniques(mean-shift, background foreground extraction, etc)} to track humans and monitor their body profile(frontal, left, right, rear and their combinations) and their occlusion states.
        
        \item Also implemented and programmed various heuristics and models to determine the pose states(standing, sitting, lying and others), the camera proximity state and the motion state(position, velocity, acceleration) of humans in videos.
        
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{1ex} 
{ \bf Employee Feedback Management System | Summer of Code'19 IIT Kanpur} \\
    \textit{Mentor: Dr. Sandeep Shukla, Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur}
    \hfill
    \textit{May'19-Jul'19}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Developed an employee performance tracking and feedback platform using modern \textbf{web technologies} like \textbf{ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB (MERN stack)}.
        \item Platform allows teams to collaborate and proactively \textbf{track goals} and receive \textbf{review based feedback} from managers, making it easy for the managers to track deadlines and work progress of each individual of their team.
        \item Also featured an inbuilt \textbf{chat application} for ease of communication between the manager and their teams.
        % \item Assisted in developing a LabVIEW interface for \textbf{Hardware in the Loop (HiL}) simulation to study regenerative chatter (unstable tool point vibration) in orthogonal cutting.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
        \item Part of \textbf{OnDevice Artificial Intelligence} Team working on \textbf{SNAP(Samsung Neural Acceleration Platform) Software Development Kit}.
        \item Developed Stable Interface(in C++) for SNAP SDK using \textbf{AIDL(Android Interface Definition Language)} as a result of which multiple applications in Samsung Devices can run \textbf{pre-trained Neural Networks OnDevice concurrently} optimizing resources like battery, CPU, GPU unlike before when only one application was able to do so.
        \item Further wrote \textbf{APIs} to provide various functionality to \textbf{Android application developers}. For eg :- Choice of - \textbf{compute engine(CPU/GPU/NPU), framework(Tensorflow, Caffe)}, etc.
        % \item The completely automated Straightening Machine has a screw self-arranging system, an induction heating mechanism, and a synchronized rolling mechanism to get the desired product.
